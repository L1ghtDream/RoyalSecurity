&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; A plugin that aims to protect your minecraft account even on non premium servers. It allows you to link
your minecraft account to your discord and receive notifications if someone connects to your account from a different ip.
If refused the ip will be blacklisted from the server for a period of time. If you get flooded with login attempts you
can lock down your account and every attempt to connect to your account will be automatically blacklisted. Also if you have
locked yourself out of your account by forgetting the password impossible as you can simply reset it on discord. This also
makes managing the rewards ar giveaways much easier to manager for admins as they can just check if you own the account.
